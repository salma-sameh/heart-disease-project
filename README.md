Heart Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores various models, evaluates their performance, and selects the best model for heart disease classification.

Project Overview
The dataset contains health-related features relevant to predicting heart disease. By analyzing these features, machine learning algorithms can assist in determining whether an individual is at risk.

Notebook Structure
Importing Libraries:
The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

numpy, pandas: For data manipulation
seaborn, matplotlib: For data visualization
scikit-learn: For model building, evaluation, and feature selection
Loading the Data:
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for exploration and preprocessing.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and removing duplicates
Scaling numerical features to improve model performance
Feature Selection:

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) are applied to identify the most important features.
Model Training:
The notebook applies various machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Each model is trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Results
The project achieves high accuracy in predicting heart disease risk. Each model's precision, recall, and F1-score are evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
